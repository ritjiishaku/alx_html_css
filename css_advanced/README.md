## CSS Techniques Used
The project leverages advanced CSS techniques, including:

### 1. CSS Variables
CSS variables are used to centralize control over theme colors and maintain consistency across the design.
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #c271ff;
  --secondary-color: #2c3e50;
  --tertiary-color: #f1c40f;
  --white: #ffffff;
  --black: #000000;
}
```

### 2. Flexbox and Grid Layouts
These techniques ensure content is aligned and distributed efficiently, making the layout adaptable to various screen sizes.
- **Flexbox** Example:
  ```css
  .hero {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
  ```
- **Grid Layout** Example:
  ```css
  .tutorial__section > div {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    gap: 2rem;
  }
  ```

### 3. Media Queries
Media queries adapt the design for different devices, ensuring optimal layout and usability.
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .tutorial__section > div {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}
```

### 4. Transitions and Hover Effects
Transitions provide smooth animations for user interactions, enhancing the visual experience.
```css
button:hover {
  background-color: var(--tertiary-color);
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}
```

### 5. Modular Design
Reusable CSS components are created for scalability and maintainability.
